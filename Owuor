# Bring in the required libraries.

# If your dataset is in a CSV file, load it.
pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv') = data

Feature Engineering # 1. Extract pertinent features from sensor data features = data[['Vibration', 'Temperature', 'Pressure', 'UsageMetrics', 'ErrorLogs']]

# Add other features, like time-based or rolling average features.

Step 2: Labeling Specify the desired variable (binary, with 0 denoting success and 1 failure).
data['FailureIndicatorColumn'] = data['Target']

3. Data Splitting: train_data, test_data, train_labels, test_labels = train_test_split(features, data['Target'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42) Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.

# 4. Training the Model: Select a Random Forest classifier and train the model with the formula model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42).fit (train_labels, train_data)

# 5. Model Evaluation # Use model.predict(test_data) to make predictions on the test set.

# Calculate the accuracy score of the model: accuracy_score(test_labels, predictions)
